Most anything you need to configure with the addon can be done from the
/nrange command.  If you need to edit anything further or want more
modifications you'll have to edit the lua yourself.

Luckily, I keep a git repository that you can access to keep up to date
without having to sacrifice your changes.  Just need to read up on git
so you can take advatange of it.

If you have any bugs or feature requests, feel free to send them my way,
I'm in the process of setting up an issue tracker among other things.
