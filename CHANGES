	Shouldn't show when you're in a vehicle on a monk any longer. lol
	nRange_SetMessage(int) sets the spell icon to NULL so we don't have it flashing when we use abilities,
	a better fix would be to actually just fix whatever is causing it to flash when an ability is used.
	Removed GetSpellInfo caching, that wasn't suppose to actually be here
	Added a new variable 'nRange_IconSet' for displaying or hiding the spell icon...  basically, a cheap workaround.
	Rewrote a lot of the addon, some frame handling stuff was left but the core of it works completely different than before
	
NOTICE:
If you want to see the old change log, look on github for nDemonic, it'll have it, we're starting fresh here.
so fresh
so clean
