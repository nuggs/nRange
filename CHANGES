	Added nRange_Clear to GetDistance for monks when they go further than 100 yards.

09/17/2013
	Added check in zone_changed_new_area to clear automatically for monks without question.  This should fix the
		the issue with it showing when it shouldn't.

09/14/2013
	Updated for 5.4
	Removed all dependancies on pets from monks to relfect changes from Blizzard
	Adjusted distance setting a smidge
	adjusted monks spell to be based on distance, may not be completely accurate
	added nRange_Reset in case monks bug out and you need to hide it.

08/24/2013
	Range should be displayed almost properly, forgive a yard or two off.
	Fixed setting distance, reversed "indoor" and "outdoour" I fucked up, sorry guys.
	Changed color setting, lol...  Now that we get distance properly(Mostly, it might be off a yard or two)...  I suck.
	Indoor outdoor transitions are still incorrectly handled, I'm working on it...

08/06/2013
	Made a few changes, I honestly don't remember what they were.  :)
	Fixed a bug from 0.7.6 which caused it to not display the distance.
	Started changing how range is stored and called.
	Had a strange dream I uploaded code last night, caused me to upload code that was broke,
		that was pretty awesome.  :/

07/29/2013
	Fixed UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED call.  Apparently, I formated my conditional incorrectly and it was setting
		stuff it should set whenever a spell was cast.
	Added distance checking, it's sloppy, it's straight from Astrolabe with help from kjado(EchoPort) with minor changes from me.
	added nRange_GetDistance for checking the distance of our ping
	We now listen for the events dealing with minimap zoom updates and pings
	Added new text nRangeDistance
	Probably a few things I forgot about.  I'm awesome like that.  Do drugs

05/22/2013
	Updated for patch 5.3
	Some other changes I don't remember, version is 0.3.0...  lol

04/04/2013
	Players should only get cached if they aren't cached already instead of clearing anyways on full cache.(Not that it matters)
	Changed max cache to 5

03/11/2013
	Version change
	Uploaded to WoWI/Curse, sorry, I was busy the past week and a half

02/26/2013
	Fixed it showing in vehicles and whatnot
	Removed a debug message from the communication module

02/23/2013
	Finished(I hope) the version tracking, took a while, i don't have many friends to test with.  :p

02/17/2013
	Started version tracking since my last little screw up.
	Corrected the cooldown calculation, it was about .5 seconds too slow.
	Ack!! Moved the UnitInVehicle call in nRange_IsActive to the beginning of the function.  Fixes it not displaying at all

02/16/2013
	Shouldn't show when you're in a vehicle on a monk any longer. lol
	nRange_SetMessage(int) sets the spell icon to NULL so we don't have it flashing when we use abilities,
	a better fix would be to actually just fix whatever is causing it to flash when an ability is used.
	Removed GetSpellInfo caching, that wasn't suppose to actually be here
	Added a new variable 'nRange_IconSet' for displaying or hiding the spell icon...  basically, a cheap workaround.
	Rewrote a lot of the addon, some frame handling stuff was left but the core of it works completely different than before
